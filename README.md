An intelligent journaling platform that transforms static entries into interactive reflections using AI.

## Why This Exists

Journaling often feels like writing into a void. Entries pile up, and it's hard to see patterns or recall past thoughts. By integrating an LLM, the journal becomes more than a static recordâ€”it becomes an active thought partner. Instead of simply storing ideas, it can connect them, surface forgotten themes, and suggest new angles to explore.

Traditional journals offer no guidance. It's difficult to remember old insights or see how current thoughts relate to previous ones. By using an LLM, you can easily revisit and build upon your past reflections. This reduces the mental effort of recalling details and encourages deeper thinking over time.

## Features
